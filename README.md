## 3. Deploying the Smart Contract Using Remix

1. **Open Remix IDE**
   - Go to [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

   - In the Remix IDE, create a new file (e.g., `MedicalRecord.sol`) and paste your smart contract code.

3. **Compile the Contract**
   - Use the Solidity compiler to compile the contract.

4. **Deploy the Contract**
   - In the "Deploy & Run Transactions" panel:
     - Select the account set up as **Master Admin** in MetaMask.
     - Deploy the contract to your selected network.
   - **Save the Contract Address** and **ABI** from the deployed contract for use in the application.

## 4. Configuring the Application with Contract Address and ABI

1. **Add Contract Address**

     ```javascript
     export const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
     ```

2. **Add Contract ABI**
   - In the `contractABI.json` file, paste the ABI obtained from Remix.
